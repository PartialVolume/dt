Program Abstract:

    'dt' is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals and for obtaining performance information.  Since verification
of data is performed, 'dt' can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.

    'dt' command lines are similar to the 'dd' program, which is popular on
most UNIX systems.  It contains numerous options to give the user complete
control of the test parameters.

    'dt' has been used to successfully test disks, tapes, serial lines,
parallel lines, pipes, and memory mapped files.  In fact, 'dt' can be used
for any device which allows the standard open, read, write, & close system
calls.  Special support is necessary for some devices, such as serial lines,
for setting up the speed, parity, data bits, etc.

Have fun,
