o Use realtime timers for microsecond resolution.
  - this will mean older OS's without this are NOT supported!
  - Windows now uses high resolution couonter for gettimeofday().

o Add multiple device/file support. (done, but very unclean!)

o Multiple threads per device/file. (done)
  - includes dynamic job control and script support

o Add SCSI I/O via SCSI library (done)
  - include SCSI triggers
  
o Add Windows memory mapped file support.
  
o Remove tape support. (cleans up code alot!)

o Switch to pread/pwrite. (retain the input/output file offset)

o Refactor main and parser to be thread safe for Python ctypes API.

o Add JSON support where appropriate, like total statistics, etc.

o Add SCSI Write Same, Unmap, etc directly in dt, to avoid spt.
