o Use realtime timers for microsecond resolution.
  - this will mean older OS's without this are NOT supported!
  - Windows now uses high resolution couonter for gettimeofday().

o Modify Windows to use extended API's, such as WriteFileEx().
  - this to allow threads to be in alertable state for other API's

o Modify Windows code to use native API's only to avoid multi-thread libc.
  - the threaded libc imposes too many restrictions, like excluding thread
    suspend/resume which may/will hang with threaded libc.

o Add multiple device/file support. (done, but very unclean!)

o Multiple threads per device/file. (done)
  - includes dynamic job control and script support

o Implement different I/O behaviours: (crud, hammer, and sio are done)
  - crud, disk hogger, sio, fops, hammer (move towards one tool for all I/O)

o Add SCSI I/O via SCSI library (done)
  - include SCSI triggers
  
o Add Windows memory mapped file support.
  
o Remove tape support. (cleans up code alot!)

o Switch to pread/pwrite. (retain the input/output file offset)
