<H2>What Is this Program Used For?</H2>
    <I>dt</I> is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the
operating system.  In its' simplest mode of operation, <I>dt</I> writes and then
verifys its' default data pattern, then displays performance statisics and other
test parameters before exiting.  Since verification of data is performed,
<I>dt</I> can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
<P>
    <I>dt</I> is conditionalized to run on Tru64 UNIX, HP-UX, SUN, ULTRIX, OSF/MK,
QNX, Linux, MacOS & FreeBSD, SCO Unixware, and Windows operating systems.
<P>
    <I>dt</I> command lines are similar to the <I>dd</I> program, which is
popular on most UNIX systems.  It contains numerous options to give the user
control of various test parameters.
<P>
    <I>dt</I> has been used to successfully test disks, tapes, serial lines,
parallel lines, pipes, and memory mapped files.  In fact, <I>dt</I> can be used
for any device that allows the standard open, read, write, and close system
calls.  Special support is necessary for some devices, such as serial lines,
for setting up the speed, parity, data bits, etc.
